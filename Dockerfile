# Using java:7 builds faster than using ubuntu:latest and adding openjdk-7-jdk ourselves
# BUT it's bigger as it include bzr, Perl, Python, which we don't actually need..
# Also this is OpenJDK, OK for dev; but for a production image with Oracle JDK,
# you may wish to use sth. like https://github.com/gratiartis/dockerfiles/blob/master/oraclejdk8/Dockerfile.
